    <h2>A little about what we're making</h2>
    <p>Let's be real there are few things that are better in life than a deep-fried chicken wing. It is no secret that dunking a battered chicken wing into a bubbling pot of hot oil yields a delightfully crispy result.
         That said, deep-frying is always a bit of a process.</p>
    <p>Not only is it messy (an apron is definitely required), but it's also such a headache to dispose of the dirty oil. So, if you're not in the mood to go through the whole procedure of deep-frying chicken wings (I don't blame you) but still want a super crunchy final product, there's one key ingredient that you need to add to your wings
         in order to yield a seemingly deep-fried snack from your oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients you'll need</h2> 
    <ul><li><strong>Oil</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Wings</strong></li></ul>  
    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <ol><li>Combine the oil and seasonings in a bag and shake to blend.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken wings to the bag, seal and shake to coat.</li>
    <li>Arrange the wings on a baking sheet and bake until crisp and cooked through.</li></ol>
